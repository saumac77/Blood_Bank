<center><b><u>Why donate blood?</u></b></center><br><br><br>
<p>
**Blood is the part of life that is given to those who need it by those who have the resource to satisfy the need. <br>The love of fellow human and a desire to share something of oneself is what singles out a blood donor from the others. <br>Emergencies occur every minute. For each patient requiring blood, it is an emergency and the patients could have set back if blood is not available.<br><br></p>

<p>
**Your blood donation may be even more special than you realize A single donation from you can help one or more patients.<br> This is possible because whole blood is made up of several useful components.<br> These components perform special functions in your body and in the body of patients who receive your blood.<br></p>

<p>
**Various blood components are Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells, Platelets, Plasma and selected Plasma Proteins.<br> Each of these components can be separated from your donated volume of blood and transfused into a specific patient requiring that particular component. <br>Thus, many can benefit from one unit of blood. Every year India requires 40 million units of 250cc blood out of which only a meager 500,000 of blood units are available.</p>
